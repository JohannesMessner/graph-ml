# graph-ml

Implementation of a Graph Neural Network using PyTorch, showing how random node initialization can help the neural network to distinguish between graphs that are indistunguishable throught the 1WL isomorphism test.

This is the results of a practical exercise assigned during the Advanced ML course at the University of Oxford.
